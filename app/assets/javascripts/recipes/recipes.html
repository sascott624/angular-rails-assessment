<!-- here we'll have an ng-repeat iterate through all of the recipes -->
<!-- which will each be rendered via a recipe directive -->
<!-- each recipe will show a recipe name, and its creater (user) -->
<!-- and will include a link to view that specific recipe -->
<!-- there should be an option to create a new recipe -->
