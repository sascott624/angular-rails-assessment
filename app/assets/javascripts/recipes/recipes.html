<!-- here we'll have an ng-repeat iterate through all of the recipes -->
<!-- which will each be rendered via a recipe directive -->
<!-- each recipe will show a recipe name, and its creater (user) -->
<!-- and will include a link to view that specific recipe -->
<!-- there should be an option to create a new recipe -->

<!-- this will be an ng-repeat of recipe in recipes.recipes -->
<!-- showing recipe.name, recipe.user, recipe.description -->
<ul>
  <li>"Recipe 1" by Some User
    <p><a href="" ui-sref='recipe'>recipe description</a></p>
